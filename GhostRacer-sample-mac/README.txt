To run GhostRacer:

1. Locate the folder GhostRacer, which should have in it files named
GhostRacer and Assets.  It's likely that the path to the folder will be
/Users/yourname/GhostRacer or /Users/yourname/Downloads/GhostRacer.

2. Open a Terminal window and type
        cd whateverThePathIs
where you should replace whateverThePathIs with the path to the GhostRacer
folder.

3. Confirm you're in the right folder by typing
        ls
which should show you the Assets folder and the GhostRacer executable.

4. Type
        ./GhostRacer
to play the game.

Alternatively, in the folder GhostRacer, you can move the Assets folder
to your home directory, then double-click on the GhostRacer executable
file.
